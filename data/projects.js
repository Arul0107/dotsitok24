    title: "SAM Pro Implementation for a Telecommunication company",
    overview:"Our client is a major telecommunication company with over 100,000 employees. They operated within a complex landscape, with a decentralised configuration of business units, and was spending a significantly large amount on software, compared to other organisations. The client had partnerships with hundreds of software vendors, with products and usage scattered amongst the business. Therefore, they recognised the requirement of having a centralised and unified view of their entire software estate.",
    whatwedid:"Phase 1 of the project centres around cost optimisation, where Dotsito offers valuable insights to comprehensively reduce our client's overall software spend. We analysed contractual and financial data related to the software estate and engaged with several stakeholders to determine feasibility of our proposed hypothesis and realisation of savings.Phase 2 of the project which runs concurrently, supports the client in a transformative SAM project, to establish an in-house SAM capability. We aligned with our client for operational requirements and are conducting workshops to facilitate configuration and implementation of the SAM tool.",
    outcome:"Millions of indicative savings identified for potential vendors across the software estate Dotsito performed a current state assessment of the client's environment toÂ highlight process gaps with industry best practices with highest risk areas that needed attention. Implemented ServiceNow SAM Pro and Discovery/ ITOM ACC-V with domain separation network.Integrated various environments e.g. EUC (SCCM, Jamf), SaaS (Adobe, M365, Salesforce etc.), and Infrastructure (IBM ILMT).",
